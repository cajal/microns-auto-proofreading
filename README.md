Modules and Schemas for Morphological Processing of EM Datasets

# Installation Instructions

This repository includes two Python packages: API and Development. 

The Development package includes a pre-configured Docker container with all necessary dependencies, including Python.

To install the API:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cajal/microns-morphology.git#subdirectory=python/microns-morphology-api
```

To run the development environment:

After cloning this repo, create a .env file inside the deploy folder. Even if you donâ€™t specify any variables, an empty .env file is required for Docker Compose to function correctly. You can include the following optional variables:

```
DJ_HOST: Optional - MySQL database host for using DataJoint  
DJ_USER: Optional - DataJoint username  
DJ_PASS: Optional - DataJoint password  
JUPYTER_PORT_CONTAINER: Optional - Desired port for accessing JupyterLab (defaults to 8888)  
JUPYTER_PASSWORD: Optional - Password for JupyterLab (defaults to no password)  
GITHUB_TOKEN: Optional - GitHub token for cloning private repositories  
```

Ensure Docker is installed and running on your system. Then run:

```
docker compose build notebook
```
The build can take several minutes. Once complete run:  
```
docker compose up -d notebook
```
The -d flag runs the container in detached mode, allowing it to run in the background.

Navigate to https://localhost:8888 in your browser. If you specified a custom port in your .env file, replace 8888 with that port.
